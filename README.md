# 🤝 Community Emergency Aid Pool

## 📌 What
The **Community Emergency Aid Pool** is a decentralized fund where members contribute a fixed monthly amount.   
When emergencies arise, members can **request funds**, and the community 🗳 votes on whether to approve the request.    
If the majority votes in favor ✅, the requested amount is automatically sent 💸 to the recipient.

**✨ Key Features:** 
- 👥 **Membership System** – Only verified contributors can participate.   
- 💰 **Monthly Contributions** – Fixed contribution amount ensures a stable fund. 
- 🆘 **Emergency Requests** – Members can request funds when needed. 
- 🗳 **Voting Mechanism** – Each member votes to approve or reject.  
- ⚡ **Automatic Execution** – Approved requests instantly release funds.
